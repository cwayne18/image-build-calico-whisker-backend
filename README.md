# image-build-calico-whisker-backend

This repo builds a hardened, statically-linked Go binary from
[github.com/projectcalico/calico](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico) and packages it in a minimal SLE BCI
(`registry.suse.com/bci/bci-nano`) based image.

Binaries are compiled against [`rancher/hardened-build-base`](https://github.com/rancher/image-build-base),
which provides the latest supported Go toolchain (FIPS/BoringCrypto-enabled on amd64).

## Images produced

- `cwayne18/hardened-calico-whisker-backend` — Calico Whisker backend

## Building locally

```sh
make build-image-all          # build for the host architecture
make image-scan               # run Trivy against the built image(s)
```

The upstream version is controlled by the `TAG` variable in the [`Makefile`](./Makefile).
A `-buildYYYYMMDD` suffix (`BUILD_META`) is appended automatically and is required on
release tags.

## Automated updates

[Updatecli](./updatecli) keeps two things current via daily PRs:

- the upstream `calico` version (`Makefile` `TAG`), and
- the `rancher/hardened-build-base` version (`Dockerfile` `GO_IMAGE`).

## CI

- **Build**: builds the image and runs a [Trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy) scan
  (`CRITICAL,HIGH`) on every PR/push.
- **Release**: on a published GitHub release, builds multi-arch images and pushes them to
  `ghcr.io/cwayne18`.
